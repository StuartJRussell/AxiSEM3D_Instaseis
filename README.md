# AxiSEM3D_Instaseis

This repository contains scripts that allow the element outputs of AxiSEM3D simulations to be converted to Instaseis database format. There are three directories:

- `Conda_Environments/` contains .yml files to create conda environments for this package, instaseis, and the mesher for AxiSEM3D.
- `Simulations/` contains the necessary scripts for setting up the simulations.
- `Postprocessing/` contains the scripts for converting the outputs of the simulations to Instaseis databases.
