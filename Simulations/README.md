# Simulations Directory

It is envisioned that simulations are created and run here, although users can edit paths as they see fit.

The script `make_simulation.py` will generate simulation directories by editing the input files contained in the `Draft_Simulation` directory. The inputs to set up each simulation are explained and can be edited in the Python script.

If users would prefer then it is also possible to copy the draft simulation and then set all the necessary inputs manually.

## Draft_Simulation Directory
This directory contains all of the draft input files. The `axisem3d_palma` executable and `submit_palma.sh` script are specific to the PALMA II cluster at the University of Muenster and will need to be replaced by the user.
